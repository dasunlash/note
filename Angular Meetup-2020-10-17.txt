restfull service use HTTP protocall to send request.there ara action verbs to send request 
get,post,put,delete for retrive,save,update,delete

restfull service is architectural pattern that  used for creating service and apiusing http protocal.

Rest constraint
 client server-client send request server send response to the client request
.
States
nothing store in the server related to the client, 
client send all necessaray data to process by the server.

cacheble 
cachening avoid unnessary processing.we can store data in memory cache  and we dont want to send requset to the server side again and again.

WCf
there are lot of configuration to  convert resful service.

extension methods are  static method .it locates inside the static class
add new method to the existing type without modifying the original source code.
