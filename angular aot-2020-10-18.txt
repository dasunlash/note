two module of compilation
 JIt
 AOT

AOT-
identifie the errors at the the compile time not the run time

ng serve command we get jit compilation not the AOT,
that is why we can identify errors at the run time.

if we type ng serve --aot true then we can errors at the compile .
instead of at the run time

JIT-compile at the run time,need to dwonlaod angular compiler
AOT-compile at the  build time,no need to downlaod angular compiler
in ng build default use the  aot.

	by default,the following 2 command s use JIT complilation
      ng build
      ng server

  if we want AOT
 ng build --aot
 ng serve --aot

to turn of AOT for the production build
  ng build --prod --aot false

------------------------

prod build
dev build
1.produce the source map(help us to easily debug applciation even after the file a
ae compressed and combined)

to generate source map-ng build -dev -sm false

with t ge dev build global styles are extrated.js files where as with prod buld 
they are extractedto.css file.
 
ng build --prod -ec false.

ng prod --build support minification and uglification 
Minification and uglification

minification-is the process of removing excess whitespces,comments
unglification use the short variable name for the function variables.

tree shaking- removeing unused code from the our project

tree shaking support by the ng build -prod and ng build --dev not support it

ng build--prod use AOT
ng build --dev doesnot use AOT
